- *OBJECTIVE:* Create a Zettelkasten vault inside a [[id:5ee85686-4255-4634-afbc-c364fa16a025][PARA system]]
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-26 05:26]:
  Why a PARA on top of Zettelkasten? PARA system provide a rigid stucture that allows planning and ease of access information
  - Zettelkasten is good for developing ideas but managing tasks in not its strong suit due to its chaotic nature
  - PARA system allows information to be stored in a structured way that is easy in intuitive to access
  - Both system have pros and cons. Im plementing PARA on top of zettelkasten allow information to accessed and stored with ease
  - Problems facing when implement both systems:
** ZK-Orgroam UID and index system

- *OBJECTIVE:* Implement the ID system to the [[id:e1fba411-956b-4add-b9d9-8882888d76c9][Zettelkasten vault]]
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-26 17:12]:
  - A UID system is the core of zettelkasten and should serve a way to navigate between notes:
    - The system should have the benefits of the [[id:0ce0544c-320b-4aef-9bad-14564ee61474][original Luhmman's ZK system]]
    - The system should work in both zettelkasten and orgroam extension
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-28 23:27]:
  - =Orgmode= built-in UID system does not provide any context for each note
  - Spliting the UID system into two sub-system is more optimal
      - A built-in =orgroam= UID system
*** ZK-Orgroam UID sub-system
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-28 23:44]:
  - Provide a unique ID for each note to prevent overlap between notes
*** ZK-Orgroam Indexing sub-system
- *[NOTE]* taken on [2025-06-29 01:10]:
  - Each note has a [[id:242353ef-f564-47bf-985f-8816c09cd780][address]] that provides contexts
  - Improve search ability by using =address= as =filename=
  - Address follow Luhmann's [[id:f78fe37b-4ff7-4a73-86e9-16ccf28a4888][Naming convention]] (alphanumeric)
